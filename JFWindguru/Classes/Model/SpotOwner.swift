/*
 *  SpotOwner
 *
 *  Discussion:
 *    Represents a model information of the stot.
 *    By inheritance the common attributes are parsed and filled in Spot.
 *    It adds 2 more properties, nick name and id of the user that controls the weather station.
 *    Probably information not useful now, but in terms of having all the data.
 *
 *     {
 *        "nickname": "oamxyz09",
 *        "id_user": "348765"
 *     }
